#Openline Ecosystem 

The openline ecosystem is composed out of 3 main parts : customerOS, Components and Applications.

## customerOS
A collection of Services that offer a simple standard of interacting with Customer data. These services are built on top of multiple types of datasources and offer a complete view of the customer journey. 

## Components
In order to make it easier to interact with customerOS, we are proposing a set of most needed components in the interactions with your customers: Forms, Authentication, Conversation Views etc. 

## Applications
Using the components and our customerOS you can build applications faster and register them to have access to all your customer data.
