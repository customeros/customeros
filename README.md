Openline makes it easy to get a complete 360-degree view of your customers.  We bring together behavioral, demographic, transactional, conversational, and social data to give you the most comprehensive view of your customer relationship.  

Third-party tracking and analytics tools do not work in the current world of GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, ad blockers, and cookie deprecation.  We allow you to get the most comprehensive view of your customers without sending personal identifying and/or usage data to third parties.

## Features

- **First-Party Event Trackers**:  Automatically track every event on your website or app.
- **Data Pipeline Tools**:  ETL / Reverse ETL tools to aggregate customer data from your favorite applications.
- **Data Integration**:  Combine and organize customer data from different sources into a single, easy-to-use schema.
- **CustomerDB**:  Real-time transactional database that is the customer system of record.
- **GraphQL API**:  Build amazing experiences based on a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the customer.
