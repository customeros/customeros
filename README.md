Openline makes it easy to get a complete 360-degree view of your customers.  We bring together behavioral, demographic, transactional, conversational, and social data to give you the most comprehensive view of your customer relationship.  

Third-party tracking and analytics tools do not work in the current world of GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, ad blockers, and cookie deprecation.  We allow you to get the most comprehensive view of your customers without sending personal identifying and/or usage data to third parties.

## Features

- **Data Integration**:  Combine and organize customer data from different sources into a single, easy-to-use schema.
