CustomerOS CLI commands are structured in the following way:

```bash
openline <topic> <command> [options]
```

Typically all commands you will give when developing will use the `dev` topic to deploy to your local dev environment.

## Commands

You can work with CustomerOS as a whole, or at the [feature or service](/en/cli/services/) level using the CLI:

| Action                       | Command                                   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Start customerOS             | `openline dev start customer-os`          |
| Stop customerOS              | `openline dev stop customer-os`           |
| Start feature/service        | `openline dev start customer-os-api`      |
| Stop feature/service         | `openline dev stop customer-os-api`       |

If you want to start a customerOS or a specific feature from a branch other than the latest branch, you can specify the branch using the `-t` option.

| Action                               | Command                                       |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Start customerOS from branch         | `openline dev start customer-os -t otter`     |
| Start feature/service from branch    | `openline dev start customer-os-api -t otter` |

If you have cloned the repo locally and want to build and install from your source, you can use the `-l` option with the path to your source code.

| Action                               | Command                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Start customerOS from source         | `openline dev start customer-os -l /path/to/local/project`     |
| Start feature/service from source    | `openline dev start customer-os-api -l /path/to/local/project` |

This command will navigate to the top level path of the customerOS repo, build all the customerOS images locally, and install them in the kubernetes cluster.

To check what is running locally, you can use the `ping` command.

| Action          | Command             |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Ping customerOS | `openline dev ping` |

You can also check the status of the customerOS pods using the `status` command.

| Action                                    | Command               |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Check status of local customerOS services | `openline dev status` |

When you want to tear down your local customerOS environment, you can do this in one of two ways:

| Action                                 | Command                           |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Uninstall all customerOS services      | `openline dev rm --all`           |
|                                        | `openline dev stop`               |
|                                        |                                   |
| Uninstall specific customerOS services | `openline dev rm <service-name>>` |


## Additional Commands

| Action                                           | Command                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Help documentation                               | `openline help`                           |
| View and create issues in the CustomerOS project | `openline issues`                         |
