# Hubspot

This guide will walk you through how to sync your [Hubspot][hubspot] data with CustomerOS. 

### Connecting your Hubspot account

CustomerOS connects to Hubspot via a Hubspot Private App.  

<Callout type="warning">
To create a private app in Hubspot, you'll need Hubspot admin privileges. 
</Callout>

1.  As the Hubspot admin, log into your [Hubspot][login] account and click on `Profile & Preferences` found under the top right user menu

4. Setup the Private App as follows:

- Name: customeros-integration
- Description:  This private app is used to sync data with CustomerOS

![guide](/images/integrations/hubspot/hubspot-basic-info.png)

- Scopes:
  - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
  - `crm.objects.companies.read`
  - `crm.objects.deals.read`
  - `crm.objects.owners.read`
  - `sales-email-read`
  - `files`
  - `files.ui_hidden.read`

<Callout type="info">
CustomerOS only requires read permissions as we don't push data back into Hubspot, so you can rest assured your data will remain unaltered within Hubspot.
</Callout>

5. Once the Private App has been created, copy the app token.

7. That's it! CustomerOS will now continuously monitor your Hubspot account for data changes and automatically sync them to CustomerOS.

### What happens to this data?

- CustomerOS collects your Hubspot data and stores this within your customer graph for easy manipulation into useful aggregations and views
  - This data includes contacts, interactions, companies, deals and more!
- Once stored in CustomerOS, this data is linked to all other customer data from other systems and inputs
  - This allows you to see the full picture about your customer without having to load data from one place to another!
