# Google Workspace (GSuite)

This guide will walk you through how to sync your [Google Workspace][google-workspace] data with CustomerOS. 

The specific data CustomerOS uses includes from the following Google Workspace services:

- Google Mail
- Google Calendar
- Google Meet
- Google Drive

This will allow you to sync your users and their data from Google Workspace into CustomerOS, allowing you to see the full picture of your customers in real-time.

### Connecting your Google Workspace

CustomerOS connects to Google Workspace using a special type of Google Workspace account called a Service Account.  

<Callout type="info">
To create a Service Account in Google Workspace, you'll need access to Google Cloud Platform on your Google Workspace with Super Administator permissions.  If you don't have this, please contact your Google Workspace administrator to help you create a Service Account.
</Callout>

1.  As the Google Workspace Super Administrator, log into your [Google Console][google-console] account. If you haven't logged in before you will have to agree to the terms & conditions shown.
Next we will create a new project to contain our Service Account. Click the button `Select a project ▾` in the upper left corner of the Console

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-0-select-project.png)

2. Now click `New Project`

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-1-new-project.png)

3. Enter a Project name and click `Create`. In this example we set the name Gmail Service Account.

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-2-create-project.png)

4. You should now have been sent to the Dashboard of your new project. From here we want to click the `+ Enable API and Services` button

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-3-enable-apis.png)

5. On the API Library page that opens, use the search box to find `Gmail API`, select it and then Enable it on the next page.

<Callout type="warning">
Note that enabling the APIs here does not instantly grant the access, it is a prerequisite to add the corresponding permission scopes later.
</Callout>

In the same way, now find and enable four more API sets for the service account:

- `Google Calendar API`
- `Google People API`
- `Google Drive API`
- `Tasks API`
- `Gmail API` (enabled above)

{/* TODO: @xvasi update with screenshot */}

6. Now the you have created the Google Project and enabled the API accesses that are required for the service account, we can create the service account itself. Click the `☰ (Navigation menu)` icon (1) in the upper left corner of the Console and select `IAM & admin` (2) > `Service accounts` (3) in the navigation pane.

7. Click the `+ Create Service Account` button

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-6-create-service-account.png)

8. Enter a name to identify the service account and fill in the Service account description field, then click `Create and continue`. **Copy the email address and Client ID of the service account, as it will be used later.**

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-7-service-account.png)

9. In the next section, set the value `Project > Owner` in the field `Select a role` and click `Continue`

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-8-select-roles.gif)

10. Click `Done` in the next section

{/* TODO: @xvasi update with screenshot */}

11. The next step, click the `⁝ (Menu)` icon in the Actions column of the created service account and select `Manage keys`

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-9-manage-keys.png)

12. On the opened page, click `Add key` and select `Create new key` from the drop-down list

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-10-add-key.png)

13. Select JSON format for the key (the default one) and click `Create`

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-11-create-json-key.png)

14. The JSON file will be downloaded to your computer; store the Key file securely, as it has access to your Gmail resources. This file will be used at a later step. Close the download notification to proceed.

{/* TODO: JSON contains \n breaks, so use echo to get the correct output, alternative is to download the PK12 not the JSON

echo “-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMxxxxx\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n”

then you get an output like
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
Mxxxxx
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----  */}

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-12-download-notification.png)

15. We now need to setup Domain Delegation. To do this return to Gmail Admin Console’s `Security` tab, then go to `Access and data control > API controls`

{/* TODO: @xvasi update with screenshot */}

16. Click `Manage Domain-Wide Delegation` at the bottom of the page

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-13-domain-wide-delegation.png)

17. Click `Add new API client`

![guide](/images/integrations/google-workspace/google-14-add-api-client.png)

18. On the opened page we need to enter the Client ID related to the service account created in step 8. We need to populate the OAuth scopes field with the following value and click `Authorize`:

- https://mail.google.com/

{/* TODO: @xvasi update with screenshot */}

<Callout type="info">
For more information about scopes you can read here: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes
</Callout>

19. Wait for 5+ minutes while Google propagates your configuration across it's systems. You now have set up a Service Account with Domain Delegation ready to integrate with CustomerOS!

20. Log into your [CustomerOS account][customeros], click on the `Settings` button and paste your Google Workspace Service Account `Private Key` and `Service Account Email` from Step 8.  Press save.

{/* TODO: @xvasi update with where Private Key came from */}

21. That's it! CustomerOS will now continuously monitor your Google Workspace account for data changes and automatically sync them to CustomerOS.

{/* TODO: update with sync details */}

### What happens to this data?

- CustomerOS collects your Google Workspace data and stores this within your customer graph for easy manipulation into useful aggregations and views
  - This data includes contacts, interactions, companies, deals and more!
- Once stored in CustomerOS, this data is linked to all other customer data from other systems and inputs
  - This allows you to see the full picture about your customer without having to load data from one place to another!
