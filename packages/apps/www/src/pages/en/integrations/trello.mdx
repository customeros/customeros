# Trello

This guide will take you through how to connect your customer data living in [Trello][trello] with CustomerOS. CustomerOS will sync all of the selected data using a Trello API key, which we will run through generating and providing to CustomerOS in this guide.
 
<Callout type="info">
To create an API key in Trello, you'll need Trello admin privileges. 
</Callout>

### Guide to linking your Trello account

1. As a Trello Admin log into your account to generate a Trello API key and API token for each Trello workspace you want to connect to CustomerOS. You can do this by going to [Trello's API management page][trello-api-key-management] to create both of these.

2. Trello manages it's API keys via `Power Ups`, so you need to create an CustomerOS Power Up first:

![Create Trello Powerup](/images/integrations/trello/trello-create-powerup.png)

3. Name your Power Up something memorable (we like CustomerOS), you will need one Power Up per workspace you want to connect to CustomerOS.

4. Next you need to create an API key:

![Generate Trello API key](/images/integrations/trello/trello-generate-key.png)

5. However, as well as this key you have just generated, you also need to generate an API token to connect Trello to CustomerOS. To do this, click on the `Token` button:

![Generate Trello API token](/images/integrations/trello/trello-api-key.png)

6. You will need to authorize the token, so click on the `Allow` button, and copy the token you are provided.

7. Log into your [CustomerOS account][customeros], click on the `Settings` button in the sidebar and paste your Trello API key and token into the `Trello API token` fields.  Press save.

8. Once configured, CustomerOS can also continuously sync your data from Trello to CustomerOS, from 1 to 24 hours from Trello into CustomerOS to make sure you always are up to date. If you need to add more than one Trello workspace to customerOS, [get in touch][help] with the team so we can help you out.

### What happens to this data?

- CustomerOS collects your Trello data and stores this within your customer graph for easy manipulation into useful aggregations and views
  - This data includes contacts, interactions, companies, deals and more!
- Once stored in CustomerOS, this data is linked to all other customer data from other systems and inputs
  - This allows you to see the full picture about your customer without having to load data from one place to another!
