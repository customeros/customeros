## Authentication

Use of the CustomerOS GraphQL API and webhooks require a CustomerOS API Key in order to make authenticated requests.

As our API is currently in `Beta`, please reach out to [developers@customeros.ai][devemail] to receive your API key.

The API key will be passed as a `X-CUSTOMER-OS-API-KEY` value in the header of all requests.

## CustomerOS GraphQL API

The CustomerOS GraphQL API provides all the functionality of CustomerOS in a single public endpoint:

```terminal
POST https://api.customeros.ai
```

You can access the GraphQL API via our hosted GraphiQL web app, curl, or any HTTP client:

- [Use the GraphiQL app][graphiql]

<Callout type="info">
The CustomerOS GraphQL API only accepts POST requests.  Other HTTP methods, such as GET or PUT, will return a `400 Bad request` or `406 Not acceptable` response.
</Callout>

## Rate Limiting

We rate limit API calls to 1000 per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a 429 response. If you need an increased limit, please contact the CustomerOS team.
